# Optimus Server

The Optimus profiler let you expose your data stats via a little http server. Our goal here is to send this data to a GUI in the client machine.
Actually we are testing this concept with [bumblebee](https://github.com/hi-primus/Bumblebee).

To run the server:
```
set "FLASK_APP=run.py"
flask run
```
